Configuring Scheduled Notifications
In the previous lecture, you learned how to schedule (local) notifications via scheduleNotificationAsync().

That method takes one argument - an object where you set the content and the trigger.

Besides the properties shown in the previous lecture, other properties could be added.

You find a complete list (+ explanations) of content properties here: https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/#notificationcontentinput

And a complete list (+ explanations) of trigger properties here: https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/#notificationtriggerinput

The trigger type may be confusing - it's basically a combination of multiple supported object types.

You could either set an interval in seconds (as we did in the previous lecture) as described here: https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/#timeintervalnotificationtrigger

Or you set a specific date (incl. time) at which the notification will be delivered: https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/#datetriggerinput

Or you set a daily time at which the notification will be sent (Android-only): https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/#dailynotificationtrigger

Or a weekly trigger (Android-only): https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/#weeklynotificationtrigger

Or a yearly trigger (Android-only): https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/#yearlynotificationtrigger

Or a specific date (iOS-only): https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/#calendarnotificationtrigger
