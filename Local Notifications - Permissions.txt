Local Notifications - Permissions
When using Expo Go, you shouldn't need to ask for any permissions to send or show local notifications (or notifications in general).

This will change as you build your app for production though. Even when using Expo's managed workflow, you will then leave the Expo Go app (as a standalone app will be built by EAS - see section 14).

To ensure that notifications work correctly, you should therefore ask for permission. For Android, no changes are required. For iOS, you can use the getPermissionsAsync() method (https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/#getpermissionsasync-promisenotificationpermissionsstatus) 

provided by expo-notifications to get the current permission status. You can use requestPermissionsAsync() (https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/#requestpermissionsasyncrequest-notificationpermissionsrequest-promisenotificationpermissionsstatus) to request permissions.

A full code example can be found here but I will also walk you through the entire permission setup later in this section as well.
